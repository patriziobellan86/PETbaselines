**Abstract**. *Process extraction from text is an important task of process discovery, for which various approaches have been developed in recent years. However, in contrast to other information extraction tasks, there is a lack of gold-standard corpora of business process descriptions that are carefully annotated with all the entities and relationships of interest. Due to this, it is currently hard to compare the results obtained by extraction approaches in an objective manner, whereas the lack of annotated texts also prevents the application of data-driven information extraction methodologies, typical of the natural language processing field. Therefore, to bridge this gap, we present the PET dataset, a first corpus of business process descriptions annotated with activities, gateways, actors, and flow information. We present our new resource, including a variety of baselines to benchmark the difficulty and challenges of business process extraction from text. PET can be accessed via  [huggingface.co/datasets/patriziobellan/PET](https://pdi.fbk.eu/pet-dataset/huggingface.co/datasets/patriziobellan/PET)*

### This repository provides the annotations, the gold standard data, and the baselines predictions of the PET dataset

The folder *crf Models* contains the trained crf model used to create *Baseline 1*
The folder *baseline scripts* contains the scripts used to create the three baselines. 
The file *petdatasetgoldstandardbaselines.json* contains the gold standard annotations of the PET dataset and the predictions of the three baselines.

## Visualizers

You can find a python package to see the goldstandard annotations and baselines predictions [here](https://pypi.org/project/PETGoldstandardBaselinesVisualizers/1.0.2/).
You can install it via pip.
```python
pip install PETGoldstandardBaselinesVisualizers==1.0.2
```
  The package provides two visualizers: 
  - BaselinePredictorAgreement, and 
  - BaselineComparisonLineview
  
#### Baseline Predictor Agreement Interface  
  
This visualizer shows the agreement between the baseline predictors and the goldstandard annotations.  
  
```python  
from Visualizers.BaselinePredictorAgreementInterface import Show as agreements  
agreements()  
```  
  
#### Baselines Comparison LineView 
  
This visualizer provides a GUI to compare the goldstandard process element annotations and the Baseline 1 ones.  
  
```python  
from Visualizers.BaselinesComparisonLineView import Show as lineview  
lineview()  
```
